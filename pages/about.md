## Early Interest in Technology and Science

During my early years before I started programming and robotics, I demonstrated insatiable curiosity towards learning subjects of higher grades from my elder sister's textbooks. This appetite for knowledge resulted in a substantial collection of notebooks on advanced topics in chemistry and mathematics. In second grade, I memorized the entire periodic table and recited it in front of the entire school in the assembly. The very next day, I even learned all its symbols and valencies, astonishing my teachers.

## Love for Computers

While in my primary grades, my fascination took a turn towards robotics. I used to build a project every week (you can have a look at them in the gallery section) and showcase them. You may also find them in Arduino's Project Hub. I learned everything through YouTube tutorials and documentations.

## Self-learning and Programming

An intriguing aspect of my coding journey is that I have not had the privilege of a formal teacher or mentor guiding me through the process. Instead, I have independently acquired my technical skills through diligent self-study using online resources.

## Cloud Computing 

My core competencies lie in designing and developing [cloud-native](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#cloud) solutions on AWS and Alibaba Cloud. With extensive production-level experience with prominent landscapes of [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/), I tackle challenges in resource allocation, horizontal scalling, container orchestration, service mesh, database management, while engineering fault-tolerant distributed ledger instances. I have also built and authored numerous cloud-based opensource solutions like modules and plugins, marketplace images for pen-testers and fostered multi-cloud intergraions. My recent works include developing CoaaS, serverless and cost-effective cloud infrastructure for personal use cases. 

## Virtualization

[Virtualization](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#virtualization) is the dearest of mine. I have designed and implemented VDI environments in financial networks, hypervisor clusters using KVM and Xen, and contributed to the development of many marketplace Docker repositories at [Alibaba](https://github.com/NishantIyer). My recent works include the development of a novel remote compute architecture that utilizes KVM to manage instances on the server-side.

## Programming

I possess programming proficiency in [Python](https://www.python.org/), a little bit of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and have a working knowledge of C and Java. I possess deep competencies in systems programming, having contributed extensively to open source projects like [fedora](https://pagure.io/user/nishantiyer). I am a haskell enthusiast and a web-developer as a hobby. I am a dedicated software architect always committed to the robust and user-friendly nature of every line of code I write. I also believe that every lline of code delivered to the public, must be public. Hence, I make a significant amount of contributions on open-source. Last year alone, I managed to ammass more than 6000 contributions. 

# Blockchain

My work in [blockchain technology](https://nishantiyer.netlify.app/projects#blockchain) runs deep, having been an early contributor to [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/), and other leading platforms where I have developed many utilities.

## Entrepreneurial Venture

Working as a volunteer for Cardano, I had the opportunity to delve into HPC (High-Performance Computing) markets, analyze their intricacies, and craft captivating custom marketplace images to share with the community. Amidst my monitoring of an HPC instance in Singapore, a thought ignited my curiosity: How much computing power is truly required to establish a remote connection to a desktop instance? To my astonishment, the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) task consumed a mere 10MB of RAM. This revelation piqued my interest as industry giants like VMware and Citrix presented DaaS (Desktop as a Service) and remote desktop solutions as alternatives, yet they necessitated a fully-fledged $500 computer. It struck me then: Why not create a diminutive microcontroller capable of serving as a client for a remote instance? And thus, the concept of Portena was born.

Our computational needs are often discrete, fluctuating between full capacity and merely a fraction thereof. Consider the scenario of an office employee utilizing a computer armed with 8GB of RAM and a quad-core processor; their computational requirements oscillate like a variable "x." At times, "x" may hover around 40%, while on other occasions, it might dwindle to a mere 10%. Regrettably, the surplus computing resource remains idle, going to waste.

Portena is meticulously designed to bridge this gap by connecting a small Single Board Computer (SBC) to a cloud server, mirroring its activities seamlessly on a desktop screen via an HDMI cable. Furthermore, Portena incorporates all the essential peripherals to empower users with effortless control over their Hybrid PCs. To establish the remote connection, I have developed a specially tailored protocol called uNet. Constructed upon TCPv8, uNet harnesses cutting-edge algorithms, ensuring high transmission rates with minimal latency. This protocol operates even in regions with limited internet connectivity, guaranteeing accessibility for users across the globe. Currently, I a, fully immersed in the prototyping phase, using the popular ESP32 microcontroller to develop a client-side solution while simultaneously working on the server-side implementation.

Portena's remote connection is facilitated through CoaaS (Compute-as-a-Service) infrastructures dispersed globally. These serverless models offer scalable "balloon-like" functions/containers that can be dynamically expanded or contracted to meet demand. Moreover, I have devised a distinctive plugin for each Portena instance, aptly named DRATP (Dynamic Resource Allocation and Task Prioritization). DRATP leverages AI/ML algorithms to optimize resource allocation and pricing, leading to cost reductions of up to 80%, as substantiated by my comprehensive tests.

Portena is still in its nascent ideation stages, and I have been ardently engrossed in prototyping, rigorous testing, and extensive research. For further insights into the remarkable technologies it embodies, please look at the blog section on our website.

If you are interested and eager to learn more about Portena or wish to get in touch, kindly reach out to me at [nishant.iyer62@gmail.com](mailto:nishant.iyer62@gmail.com). I would be delighted to engage in a profound discussion about this visionary project.
