Hey, I am Nishant Iyer

14-year-old founder and chief executive @ Portena - world's foremost remote desktop architecture. With extensive knowledge and experience in a variety of domains of IT like virtualization, cloud, software architecture, systems engineering, and networking, I strive to make meaningful waves in the industry through my intense work ethic and indomitable drive.

Ex Companies- Ethereum (2021-22). Cardano Community(2022).
 
Orchestration | VDI | Virtualization | KVM | Blockchain Development and DeFi | Haskell lover | Python | Plutus (Cardano) | Network Protocols | CaaS - ensured HA, FT with DLTs for 1 year

Having been around computers since I was 7, I acquired this proficiency through diligent self-study and hands-on experience. This early exposure to computers ignited a fire within me, driving me to constantly seek new challenges and expand my horizons. Through countless hours of self-study and experimentation, I honed my skills and developed a deep understanding of intricate IT concepts. From configuring complex virtualization environments to architecting robust software systems, I have embraced every opportunity to push the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of technology. My passion for innovation and problem-solving fuels my desire to make a lasting impact across the broader landscape of IT. With an unyielding determination and a hunger for knowledge, I am poised to continue my journey of growth and success.

I am currently grinding in the development and ideation of Portena, which has made me somewhat inactive in the industry and community; hope y'all are doing well without me!
